# CTEs

## What is a Common Table Expression?
> A Common Table Expression (CTE) is a modern SQL feature used to define a
> temporary result set. CTEs can also be considered query-level views or
> query-level temporary tables.

> The main purpose of using CTEs is to simplify complex queries. This is generally done
> by using CTEs instead of nested subqueries. This usually makes queries more
> readable for developers and often allow the database query optimizer to improve
> query execution times.
